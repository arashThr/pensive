# Decisions

Reasoning behind the decisions I've made, so I don't have go through them again:

## Open source
Closed source makes more sense for now:
- What are the chance to get contributors if there are no users?
- Clearer monetization, protects the AI implementation details, and forces me to build a sustainable business rather than hoping for GitHub stars
- Pushes me to think about the real problem: How to market, find customers and add values to the product
