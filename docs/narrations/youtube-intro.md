## Short intro

Pensive lets you save the cool pages you find on the internet so you can build your own searchable memory of the web.
With Pensive, you can not only search within articles but also ask questions across the collection of pages you’ve saved.

Here’s how it works: You read an interesting article that you want to save. You have two options — on your desktop, you can use the browser extension to save it; if you’re on your mobile phone, just share it with the Pensive Telegram bot.

This link will now be added to your library, along with all its content. We even keep a Markdown version of the page.

Now, the important part: how to find something in your library. You have two options. First, you can use full-text search — it scans the content of all the pages you’ve saved and finds the ones containing the terms you entered.

The second option is to ask a question. Using this feature, you can interact with your entire knowledge base in natural language. Just ask, and it will find the right answer based on the articles you’ve saved. It even tells you which resources it used for the answer.

It’s that simple.

Now go to getpensive.com, create an account, and start capturing your best experiences on the web. Never lose what you’ve found again.

## Story

You find an amazing article, you read it, you enjoy it—but later, you just can’t find it.
That was my problem. I remember once finding this blog about mechanical watches—beautiful animations and detailed explanations like I’d never seen before.
But later, when I wanted to show it to a friend, I just couldn’t find it.

Good luck finding it on Google. It just throws sponsored links at you, mixed with bot-generated content from Quora and Reddit.
I started the habit of bookmarking good pages, but my bookmarks turned into a graveyard of links.

I needed something that would let me search through the full text of articles, not just the titles.
I call it Pensive—not to be confused with the Pensieves from Harry Potter.

It’s built for search: you read something, you save it, and you’ll find it later. Here’s how:

Here’s an article I was reading about blah the other day.
To save it, I use the browser extension I installed. I save it—and now it’s saved.

Let’s click on “View Page” to see what we’ve saved: we have the opening paragraph and a short AI-generated summary. We also keep the markdown version of the page.

Now, how can I find it? I just go to the main page. There, I have two options:
	1.	Do a full-text search — great when I’m looking for something specific and remember some of the wording.
	2.	Ask the AI — it goes through all your saved documents, finds the most relevant ones, and uses your captured knowledge to answer your question.

But what if you’re on your phone? You can install our app.
Of course not—who likes to install another app? Just go to our extensions page; with one click, you can log in to the Telegram bot for Pensive. Now you can send links to the bot to save them or search your articles right there.

Pretty cool, huh?
Just go to getpensive.com and try it.
